 * The HauxHunt lockup: the stacked-chevron house mark above the company name.
 *
 * The asset is the supplied artwork cropped to its own alpha bounds — the
 * source carried roughly 35% transparent padding, which would otherwise have
 * shrunk the visible mark to nothing inside the nav's height budget. Stored as
 * lossless WebP because the artwork is flat black on transparency, where lossy
 * encoding leaves visible ringing around the letterforms.
 *
 * Marked decorative: the link that wraps it carries the accessible name, so an
 * alt here would announce the destination twice.
 *
 * Note on scale: the company name occupies only ~14% of the lockup's height,
 * so at any size a horizontal navigation bar can accommodate it reads as a
 * brand signature rather than as legible type. That is a property of a stacked
 * lockup in a horizontal bar, not of the sizing chosen here.
