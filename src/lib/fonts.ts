/**
 * Typography — official HauxHunt brand identity.
 *
 * Aether is the single sitewide typeface: display weight for statements,
 * regular weight for body copy, and every step of the 12-token scale in
 * between. There is no display/body pairing and no decorative secondary
 * family — one family carrying the whole system is what makes the interface
 * read as precise rather than assembled.
 *
 * Aether is not distributed through `next/font/google`, so it is declared as a
 * plain family in the CSS font stack (`--font-sans` in `globals.css`) rather
 * than loaded here. To self-host it:
 *
 *   1. Drop `aether-{regular,medium,semibold,bold}.woff2` into `public/fonts/`.
 *   2. Uncomment the `@font-face` block at the top of `src/app/globals.css`.
 *
 * Until those files land, the stack falls through to the system UI sans. The
 * fallbacks are ordered so metrics stay close to Aether's, which keeps the
 * eventual swap from shifting layout (CLS budget < 0.1).
